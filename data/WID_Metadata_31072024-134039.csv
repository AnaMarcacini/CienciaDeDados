The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20. The base unit is the tax unit defined by national fiscal administrations to measure personal income taxes.;Pre-tax national income =Pre-tax labor income [total pre-tax income ranking]+Pre-tax capital income [total pre-tax income ranking];;"Before 2014, [URL][URL_LINK]http://wid.world/document/b-garbinti-j-goupille-and-t-piketty-inequality-dynamics-in-france-1900-2014-evidence-from-distributional-national-accounts-2016/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Garbinti, Goupille-Lebret and Piketty (2018), Income inequality in France, 1900-2014: Evidence from Distributional National Accounts (DINA), Journal of Public Economics; [/URL_TEXT][/URL] After 2014, [URL][URL_LINK]https://wid.world/document/predistribution-vs-redistribution-evidence-from-france-and-the-u-s/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Bozio, A., Garbinti, B., Goupille-Lebret, J., Guillot, M., Piketty, T. “Predistribution vs. Redistribution: Evidence from France and the U.S.”, World Inequality Lab WP 2020/22[/URL_TEXT][/URL]; For long run series (full population), [URL][URL_LINK]http://wordpress.wid.world/document/longrunpaper/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Chancel, L., Piketty, T. “Global Income Inequality 1820-2020: The Persistence and Mutation of Extreme Inequality” (2021)[/URL_TEXT][/URL]; For long run series (full population), [URL][URL_LINK]http://wordpress.wid.world/document/longrunpaper/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Chancel, L., Piketty, T. “Global Income Inequality 1820-2020: The Persistence and Mutation of Extreme Inequality” (2021)[/URL_TEXT][/URL][URL][URL_LINK]http://wordpress.wid.world/document/historical-inequality-series-on-wid-world-updates-world-inequality-lab-technical-note-2023-01/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT] ; Chancel, L., Moshrif, R., Piketty, T., Xuereb, S., (2023),  ""Historical Inequality Series on WID.world - Updates""[/URL_TEXT][/URL]";[[1820, 1900], [2019, 2021]];
FR;France;lpfghg999i;p90p100;tCO2 equivalent/cap;Personal carbon footprint (all sectors). Average per capita group emissions All Ages. individuals;;;Modeled estimates based on the systematic combination of survey and tax data, national accounts and Environment Input-Output tables. Estimates include emissions embedded in imports and exports of goods and services. This indicator represents emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. This indicator also includes a component representing emissions associated with individuals' investments. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution inequality in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).
